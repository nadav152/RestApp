# RestApp
This is a back-end REST API app that was build during a school project.

The project was build with the help of a few team members.
In this project, we used the SpringBoot platform to create a basic API endpoint for HTTP requests.
This API app supports basic app actions such as :

 - Creating new users with Admin/Manager/player permissions.
 - Creating app items that can represent objects. (in our case the subject was a country club, therefor items were towels/pool/gym, etc)
 - Creating operations on items.
 - Preforming admin actions.
 - Retrieving Objects from the DB while supporting Paginations methods.
 - Updating Objects according to user's permissions.
